# Introduction 
This project is part of a series of roadmaps.

This project is not intended to be a guide, or a manual for using GIT.

In the [bibliography](#bibliography) of this project you can find all the sources used.

In this [image](./sources/roadmaps/GitHub_RoadMap.png) you can find in the roadmap on which the development of the project has been based

# Objective
The objective of this project is to reinforce the author's knowledge of Git, while at the same time attesting and demonstrating it.

It is not intended to be a practical guide to GIT and it is not intended to follow any specific course. We will simply try commands found in the official GIT documentation and try some online version control services.

- **git checkout [branch-name]**: Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory.
- **git merge [branch]**: Merges the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch.
- **git pull [Repository Link]**: Fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory.
- &#x2611; **git push [alias] [branch]**: Transmits local branch commits to the remote repository branch.
